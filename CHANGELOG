* enhance syslog reports - to include thread details
0.6.6.0: 2017-04-19
* now runs 'thread' based, xfer is always a thread - i.e., ps -p <PID> -mo THREAD will
  always show at least two threads (one or more for socket communication and the initial
  thread that starts the others and presents the usage value(s) at the end

0.6.5.0: 2017-04-14
* quick release with improved syslog reporting - 1st release

0.6.4.X: 2016 several dates

0.6.2.0: 2014-06-03

* changed format of IBytes and Obytes to KBytes (I KB, O KB) of perfstat stats
* testing with AIX 6.1, but packaging for AIX 5.3
* start deleting all global variables - everything to be malloc() created, or on stack
* reduced effect of AIX 5.3 perfstat bug by setting values to zero when delta

* added syslog reporting to local2 facility

0.5.2.0: 2013-12-09
