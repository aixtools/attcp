AIX TTCP

This program is based on the TTCP.C program developed in the early 80's.
I also borrowed some ideas from one modification called ETTCP.

The programs were very old, and worked - but the usage reporting
values were based on times() structures and data and in todays
virtualized world I felt it was time for some usage of the performance
API's provided by AIX.

Similiar to another tool developed by a team from HP I hope to provide
an neutral interface (e.g., times() based) that can be linked to on
other systems.

An idea from ETTCP was to have two program that would blow/suck
data over the network. I am now calling the services ttcp_send/ttcp_read
so that there origin and purpose is more clear on a scan of the
/etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf file.

Note: the TTCP_read and ATTCP_send will read and send from/to anything.
It is up to the calling program to terminate the connection.
However, both are configured to terminate automatically after 30 seconds
if the calling program has not finished before that time.

The program TTCP could also be used as a very simple FTP program.
For security reasons the write to file descriptors 0 and 1 is removed.

For the time being data packets writing only NULL bytes are being sent.
I will look for look for some efficient ways to modify the data being sent
anticipating the day when switches or other network components are doing
compress/decompress on the fly.
