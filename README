Another TTCP aka AIX TTCP

This program is based on the TTCP.C program developed in the early 80's
by Mike Muuss. See http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ttcp.html for history.

While the program worked the usage values were based on times() structures
and data. In todays virtualized world I felt it was time for some usage of
the performance API's provided by AIX (libperfapi).

I left a POSIX based interface - as the default report - based on
getrusage() and time() related calls. This also works on Debian
Linux on POWER (and I would hope on other *NIX platforms).

From E program named ETTCP I adopted the concept of having "inetd" ready
services to send/receive data - and on AIX /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services
are automatically updated when installing and removing attcp.

The original program TTCP could also be used as a very simple FTP program.
For security reasons I removed that feature.
