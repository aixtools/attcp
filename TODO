ToDo:
* add delay ala niping
* start ground work for threads -- started v0.6.0
** need to identify bits that are thread specific - e.g., sd, calls, bytes,
** start/stop time, IP addr? to/from (i.e., sinMe,sinThem), etc..
*** same idea, but not global

@@ ala portd - connect to a known port to get an active listener,
@@@ request a new listener from a specific
@@@ port or singular IPaddr:port


Code interlocks to prevent invalid command line switches being
specified.
Make it work when there is no connectivity (timeout somewhere).
@@ alarm() turn on on start, deactivate once port connects or listen returns
@@ mainly a way to stop listening "forever".

Windows port
@@@ doubtful - would need windows development environment
